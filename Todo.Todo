codeAdd loading support for various objects @ FileHandler.cs 103
DP: add attributes and functions as we go; it shouldn't be that difficult
feature notes:
    using * from namespace;
    using var from namespace as e;
    namespace.var;
features to be added:
    lambdas
    temp and permanent modifiers to variables, by default permanent code has temp variables and temp code has permanent variables
    extension methods


revamp syntax.
When possible:
Verify(probably will fail) that all keywords are accounted for in TokenTypeType and subsequent commands namespace classes and ParseScope, etc.
Implementation defails:
    If: while there is an else if, keep extracting; and finally if there is an else extract that as well.
    built-in methods are just methods, with identifiers, etc instead of kw
    String id should be namespace/namespace.valueType>attribute>attribute
Immediate:
